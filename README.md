# .NET-Form-V2
Modified version of the normal Windows Form in .NET

# What changes where made?
- When it shows is with a fade-in and fade-out effect (can be disabled too).
- Well, you can change the title bar color along with its font.
- You can adjust the border width and its color too.
- You can change the Minimize, Maximize and Exit colors buttons (Idle and Over)
- Adjust the height of the title bar (minimum 22 pixels)
- Add an EDGE color of the form

# Requirements
- Using VB.net (at least for now, I'm going to do a C# version)
- Or you can wrap the class in a DLL and then use it in a C# lang. env.

# What is missing
- C# version of this class.
- The new standard (since Win 7) behavior of normal Forms: When you drag the Form along with your cursor pointer to an edge of the screen.

# How to use it
- Add this class to your proyect
- Create a new Form from your Visual Studio env.
- Go to the .design file your new Form has.
- Change the inheritance code saying your new Form inherites this class
- Profit
